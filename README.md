# Cercocarpus

Cercocarpus ledifolius is a North American species of mountain
mahogany known by the common name curl-leaf mountain mahogany and one
of the many native plants that I see daily that bring me great joy.

Cercocarpus is also the name of this reposiitory which contains a set
of utility tools written in Python for hacking text data. I originally
wrote many of these tools in Perl and am slowly migrating those
scripts to Python here, so depending on when you visit, there may not
be much here yet.  These are scripts that I have found useful over the
years for working with data on the command line.  In some cases,
similar tools exist, but I wanted slightly different behavior than the
existing tools, or just felt like writing my own.  If they are useful
to you also, please feel free to use them as you wish.  If you find a
bug, please report it and I will try to fix it ASAP.  If you have
feature requests, please fork and impliment them yourself.  If you
make modifications that you think are generally useful and are in
keeping with the general vibe of the existing tools, feel free to
submit a pull request.

This project has just gotten started, so check back later when
more things have been added.
